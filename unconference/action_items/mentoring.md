# Mentor someone from a marginalized community

Either participate or create a mentorship program dedicated to marginalized folks.

This action can help overcome the following barriers: 

```{tags} power imbalance, language, accessibility
```

## Recommendations

To start with, it is easier to participate in an existing mentorship program
to maximize the chances of both mentees and mentors enjoying the experience.
One such choice is [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) which only accepts mentees from
marginalized communities; alternatively, your organization could internally
enforce affirmative action while participating on a generalist mentorship program.

## Success application examples

PyMC having mentees from marginalized communities (from both Outreachy and Google Summer of Code programs)
acted as a catalyst for the collaboration between PyMC and [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org).
Through this collaboration, [many resources](https://www.dataumbrella.org/open-source/contributing-to-pymc) on contributing to PyMC were generated in different formats and languages, multiple sprints and webinars were organized and a few people who joined through these events continued involved with the project after they finished. The [Data Umbrella blog](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/tags/#pymc) has more details on all the events.
